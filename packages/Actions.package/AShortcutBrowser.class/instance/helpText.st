' The shortcut browser is used to assign key combinations to different actions. Our shortcut browser is divided into two 
 sections. In the left section you can choose between the different classes where you can use your shortcuts. Perhaps 
 individual classes have been renamed. You can see the actual class name in the balloon text that appears by hovering your
 mouse over the name. After selecting a class you will see the available actions in the right section. By hovering your mouse
 over a specific action, a ballon text appears, with a short description of the specific action.
 
 Add Shortcut:

 To add a key combination to an action, you can right-click the action and select "Add keyboard shortcut". After that you
 can assign a key combination by hovering your mouse over the event capturer window and pressing the desired key
 combination. Press "ok" to add the shortcut. If you changed your mind you can press "cancel" to close the event capturer. 
 
 If you choose a key combination that is already assigned to another action, you will receive a warning message. Press 
 "Yes" if you still want to choose the selected key combination and want to delete the combination for the other action.
