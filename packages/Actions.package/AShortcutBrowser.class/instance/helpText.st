^' The shortcut browser is used to assign key combinations to different actions. Our shortcut browser is divided
 into two sections. In the left section you can choose between the different classes where you can use your shortcuts.
 After selecting a class you will see the available actions in the right section.

 Add Shortcut:

 To add a key combination to an action, you can right-click the action and select "Add keyboard shortcut".
 After that you can assign a key combination by hovering your mouse over the event capturer window and
 pressing the desired key combination. Press "ok" to add the shortcut. If you changed your mind you can press
 "cancel" to close the event capturer. 

 Remove Shortcut:

 To remove a shortcut, right-click an action where you assigned a shortcut. A list of your assigned shortcuts will
 open. To remove a shortcut, simply left-click the shortcut you want to remove.

 Reset your shortcuts:

 If you want to reset your shortcuts to the default implementation you have two different options:

 1. Reset shortcuts of one class:
 Simply select your desired class with a left-click. Then left-click the "Reset"-Button next to the "Help"-Button. Press "yes"
 to reset your shortcuts of the class to default, press "no" if you want to cancel your action.

 2. Reset all shortcuts:
 Left-click the "Reset all"-Button next to the "Reset"-Button. Press "yes" to reset your shortcuts of the class to default, 
 press "no" if you want to cancel your action.'
